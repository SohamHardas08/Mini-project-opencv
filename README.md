For the image processing and recognition, we used computer vision module of python, called OPENCV. The entire code is divided into 4 main parts namely:
1.	Web-cam setup
2.	Image processing
3.	Object dimensions and calculations
4.	Python to Arduino Cloud communication

Dependencies/modules used in this code:
1.	cv2
2.	time
3.	logging
4.	nest_asyncio
5.	math
6.	sys
7.	ArduinoCloudClient from arduino_iot_cloud
8.	import glob
9.	from pathlib import Path
